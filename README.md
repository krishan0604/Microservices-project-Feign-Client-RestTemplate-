🚀 Thrilled to share my new project on Microservices Architecture!

In this project, I explored and implemented:
✅ Feign Client – Declarative REST API calls
✅ RestTemplate – Synchronous inter-service communication
✅ Eureka Server – Service registration & discovery
✅ Zipkin – Distributed tracing for better observability
✅ Spring Boot Admin – Monitoring microservices health & metrics

🔹 Tech Stack: Spring Boot | Microservices | Feign Client | RestTemplate | Eureka | Zipkin | Admin Server | REST API
🔹 Goal: To build a scalable, maintainable, and observable microservices ecosystem.

This project gave me deep insights into how real-world microservices communicate, monitor, and scale effectively. 🌍
